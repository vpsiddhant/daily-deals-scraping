# daily-deals-scraping
I am making a API/website/csv where I display daily amazon and flipkart sales by scraping their webpage

<br>**You need the following this to run this program**

<br> -Python 2.7.12
<br>-Selenium
<br>-BeautifulSoup
<br>-Firefox
<br>
**Installing selenium and BeautifulSoup**
>sudo pip install selenium<br>
>sudo pip install bs4<br>

**What each file does** <br>
1. flipkart.py scrapes the daily flipkart deals and inserts in a csv<br><br>
2. amazon.py scrapes all amzon deals and inserts in a csv, but since amazon has 313 pages of deals dont run it unless you have lot of time<br><br>
3. amazon_scraping_first_page.py''' scrapes the deals from first page of amazon<br>
